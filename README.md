# Chatdraw 22L (twenty-two litres)

based off https://github.com/12Me21/chatdraw2

this has layers. you can add/remove them on the fly and see them all at once.

you can move layers and clone existing onces

you can combine your layers into a single image with `EXPORT`  
`SAVE LAYER` and `LOAD LAYER` work on your currently selected layer  
`SAVE` and `LOAD` will stitch/unstitch your layers vertically, effectively saving/loading all your layers at once.

to change resolution and palette size, add `?WIDTHxHEIGHTcCOLORS`. COLORS can be up to 16. i wouldn't recommend really big canvases over 500x500 cause then it gets kinda slow and uses a lot of memory
